/**
 * Category: 🏦 Financial Operations
 * Demo: onWhaleAlert() — monitor large transfers above a threshold.
 *
 * This observer triggers when transfers exceed a specified amount threshold,
 * useful for monitoring large financial movements on the blockchain.
 * The threshold can be specified for any supported asset type.
 *
 * Filter Function Inputs:
 * - `threshold: asset` - Minimum transfer amount to trigger alert (use bot.chain.hiveCoins() or similar)
 *
 * Callback Data:
 * The callback receives data of type {@link IWhaleAlertProviderData},
 * which is automatically deduced from the set of configured filters.
