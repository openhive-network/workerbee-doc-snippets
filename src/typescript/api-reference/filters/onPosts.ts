 * Demo: onPosts() — monitor new posts by specific authors.
 *
 * This observer monitors new post creation on the Hive blockchain. Filters by
 * specific author account names and captures complete operations/transactions.
 * Multiple authors can be monitored at single observer call.
 *
 * Filter Function Inputs:
 * - `...authors: TAccountName[]` - Author account names to monitor for new posts
 *
 * Callback Data:
 * The callback receives data of type {@link IPostProviderData},
 * which is automatically deduced from the set of configured filters.
