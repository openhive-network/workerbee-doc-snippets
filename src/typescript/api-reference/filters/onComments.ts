 * Demo: onComments() — log new comments by authors.

 * This observer monitors new comment creation on the Hive blockchain. Filters by
 * specific author account names and captures replies to posts and nested comment
 * threads. Multiple authors can be monitored at single observer call.
 *
 * Filter Function Inputs:
 * - `...authors: TAccountName[]` - Author account names to monitor for new comments
 *
 * Callback Data:
 * The callback receives data of type {@link ICommentProviderData},
 * which is automatically deduced from the set of configured filters.
