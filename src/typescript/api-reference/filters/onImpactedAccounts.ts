/**
 * Category: 👤 Account Management
 * Demo: onImpactedAccounts() — monitor all operations affecting accounts.
 *
 * This observer triggers when ANY operation affects the specified accounts
 * (transfers, votes received, mentions, follows, etc.). This provides comprehensive
 * account activity monitoring across all operation types.
 *
 * Filter Function Inputs:
 * - `...accounts: TAccountName[]` - Account names to monitor for any activity
 *
 * Callback Data:
 * The callback receives data of type {@link IImpactedAccountProviderData},
 * which is automatically deduced from the set of configured filters.
 * Collected operations are grouped by account to allow easy association to the impacted account.
