/**
 * Category: 👥 Social & Content
 * Demo: onCommentsIncomingPayout() — monitor replies/comments near payout window.
 *
 * This observer triggers when replies/comments (not top-level posts) by specified authors are approaching their
 * payout window (7 days after creation). Useful for monitoring engagement performance
 * before final payout. Multiple authors can be monitored simultaneously.
 *
 * Filter Function Inputs:
 * - `relative: string` - Time window specification (e.g., "-30m" for last 30 minutes before payout)
 * - `...authors: TAccountName[]` - Author account names to monitor for upcoming comment payouts
 *
 * Callback Data:
 * The callback receives data of type {@link ICommentMetadataProviderData},
 * which is automatically deduced from the set of configured filters.
