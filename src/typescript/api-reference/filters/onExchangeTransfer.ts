 * Demo: onExchangeTransfer() — monitor transfers to/from known exchanges.

 * This observer triggers when transfers involve known exchange accounts.

 * both deposits to and withdrawals from these exchange accounts.
 *
 * Filter Function Inputs:
 * - No parameters required (monitors all transfers involving known exchanges)
 *
 * Callback Data:
 * The callback receives data of type {@link IExchangeTransferProviderData},
 * which is automatically deduced from the set of configured filters.
